/*
	 * 1.Understanding the problem to detailed level (clarity on input and output,constraints)
	 * Yes
	 * input -- int[] 
	 * output -- int[]
	 * 2.Frame Test data (valid, invalid, complex and edge cases)
	 * Valid Testcases:
	 * 1.input : nums : {2,4,1,3}  -- output -- nums :{2,1,4,3}
	 * 2.input : nums : {4,2,5,7}  -- output -- nums :{4,5,2,7}
	 * 
	 * 3.Do you know the Solution?
	 * Yes
	 * 4.Do you have any alternate approaches? (Thing of alternate approaches)
	 * Yes
	 * 5. Derive Pseudo code in paper (for the best chosen approach) Use ChatGPT to get approach or hints not the entire solution or complete code. USE THIS ONLY
	 *  WHEN YOU ARE UNABLE TO GET THE APPROACH FOR A GIVEN PROBLEM AFTER APPLYING ALL WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT AND PRACTICED + Remember how your brain is converting the test data input to its expected output!
	 
	 > Initialize the integers left = 0  and right = nums.lenght -1 and temp
	 > while loop to iterate the array left<right
	 > if the left value divisible by 2 and num[left] value is divisible by 2 than increment 
	 > if the right value is divisible by 2 not equal to zero and num[right] value is not divisible by 2 then decrement 
	 > if both value of left is is not divisible by 2
	 
	 * 6.Dry run the pseudo code with all test data from step #2
	 * 
	 * 7.Write the code on notepad
	 * 
	 * 8. Dry run the code with all test data from step #2
	 * 
	 * 9. Write code on IDE (remember to add comments and practice coding standards)
	 * 
	 * 10. Test the code + Debug the code (if any failures) Debug like a pro using debugging options of IDE
	 * 
	 * 11. Check for any gaps of code optimization (if not optimized already in Step #9)
