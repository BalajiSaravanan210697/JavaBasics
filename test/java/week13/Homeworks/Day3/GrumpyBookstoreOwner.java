/*
	 * 1.Understanding the problem to detailed level (clarity on input and output,constraints)
	 * Yes
	 * input - int[] ,int[],int
	 * output - int
	 * 2.Frame Test data (valid, invalid, complex and edge cases)
	 * Valid Test Case : Input: customers = [1,0,1,2,1,1,7,5], grumpy = [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1], minutes = 3 Output: 16
	 * 3.Do you know the Solution?
	 * Yes
	 * 4.Do you have any alternate approaches? (Thing of alternate approaches)
	 * No
	 * 5. Derive Pseudo code in paper (for the best chosen approach) Use ChatGPT to get approach or hints not the entire solution or complete code. USE THIS ONLY
	 *  WHEN YOU ARE UNABLE TO GET THE APPROACH FOR A GIVEN PROBLEM AFTER APPLYING ALL WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT AND PRACTICED + Remember how your brain is converting the test data input to its expected output!
	 
	 > Initialize the pointer pointer1 to zero and pointer to zero of the customer array of the grumpy array  sum to zero 
	 > while loop to iterate till the pointer1 reaches the customer length - minutes
	 > while loop to iterate till the pointer2 reaches the grumpy array length - minutes
	   if the value of pointer2 is 0 than add the value to sum and increment pointer2
	    else increment the pointer2
	 >    
	
	 
	 * 6.Dry run the pseudo code with all test data from step #2
	 * 
	 * 7.Write the code on notepad
	 * 
	 * 8. Dry run the code with all test data from step #2
	 * 
	 * 9. Write code on IDE (remember to add comments and practice coding standards)
	 * 
	 * 10. Test the code + Debug the code (if any failures) Debug like a pro using debugging options of IDE
	 * 
	 * 11. Check for any gaps of code optimization (if not optimized already in Step #9)
