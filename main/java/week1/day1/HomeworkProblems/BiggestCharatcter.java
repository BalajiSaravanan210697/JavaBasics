	/* 1) Did I understand the problem?  
	 *  Given a sorted character array and a target character, 
        find the next biggest character in the array.
        Example:
        char[] cha = {‘b’, ‘d’ , ‘h’}; char k = ‘e’ 
        Output -> h
	Description : To find the next biggest character in the char array based on given input
	* 		-> If yes, go to next step !!
	 * 
	 *    What is the input(s)? char[] and char 
	 *    What is the expected output? char
	 *    Do I have constraints to solve the problem? 
	 *    Do I have all informations to go to next step!!
	 *    
	 * 2) Test data set
	 *  	
	 *  	Minimum of 3 data set !! Positive, Edge, Negative 
	 *      char[] cha = {‘b’, ‘d’ , ‘h’}; char k = ‘e’ 
	 * 
	 * 3) Do I know how to solve it?
	 * 	    Yes - great. - Ask for tip
	 * 
	 * 4) Ask for hint (If you do not know how to solve)
	 * 
	 * 5) Start always with Pseudo code 
	 * 1.Get the char[] and character target character input value
	 * 2.Iterate the given char[] using the for loop 
	 * 3.
	 * 
	 * 6) Implement them in the code (editor)
	 * 
	 * 7) Test against the different data set 
	 * 
	 * 8) If it fails, debug them to solve it !!
