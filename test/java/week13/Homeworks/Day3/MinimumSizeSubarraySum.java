public class MinimumSizeSubarraySum {
/*
	 * 1.Understanding the problem to detailed level (clarity on input and output,constraints)
	 Yes
	 input  - int[] , int
	 output - int
	 
	 * 2.Frame Test data (valid, invalid, complex and edge cases)
	 * valid test case :
	 * 1. Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3] Output: 2
	 * 2. Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4] Output: 1
	 * 3. Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] Output: 0
	
	 * 3.Do you know the Solution?
	 * Yes
	 * 4.Do you have any alternate approaches? (Thing of alternate approaches)
	 * Yes
	 * 5. Derive Pseudo code in paper (for the best chosen approach) Use ChatGPT to get approach or hints not the entire solution or complete code. USE THIS ONLY
	 *  WHEN YOU ARE UNABLE TO GET THE APPROACH FOR A GIVEN PROBLEM AFTER APPLYING ALL WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT AND PRACTICED + Remember how your brain is converting the test data input to its expected output!
     
     > Initialize the integer variables left and right equal to zero and minimum equal to zero and sum value to zero
     > while loop to iterate till right reaches the array length
     >  sum the values from the nums array both left and right 
     >  if the sum value is greater than or equal to target  
     >  decrement the left pointer 
     >  else increment the right pointer 
     
	 * 6.Dry run the pseudo code with all test data from step #2
	 * 
	 * 7.Write the code on notepad
	 * 
	 * 8. Dry run the code with all test data from step #2
	 * 
	 * 9. Write code on IDE (remember to add comments and practice coding standards)
	 * 
	 * 10. Test the code + Debug the code (if any failures) Debug like a pro using debugging options of IDE
	 * 
	 * 11. Check for any gaps of code optimization (if not optimized already in Step #9)
