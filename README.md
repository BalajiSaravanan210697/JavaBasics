# 🧪 LeetCode DSA Practice – Java (QA / SDET Focus)

This repository contains my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice using Java**, focused on strengthening **problem-solving, logical thinking, and coding skills required for QA / SDET roles**.

As a **Senior Test Automation Engineer**, I use this repository to improve:
- Logical reasoning and edge-case analysis
- Efficient coding practices
- Algorithmic thinking for automation frameworks
- Interview readiness for QA / SDET roles

Currently, I have solved **70+ LeetCode problems** across multiple DSA categories and patterns.
