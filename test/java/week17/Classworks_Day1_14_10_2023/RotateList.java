/*
	 * 1.Understanding the problem to detailed level (clarity on input and output,constraints)
	 * Yes
	 * input  - List,int
	 * output - List
	 * 2.Frame Test data (valid, invalid, complex and edge cases)
	 * 1.Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2 Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
	 * Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4 Output: [2,0,1]
	 * 3.Do you know the Solution?
	 * Yes
	 * 4.Do you have any alternate approaches? (Thing of alternate approaches)
	 * No
	 * 5. Derive Pseudo code in paper (for the best chosen approach) Use ChatGPT to get approach or hints not the entire solution or complete code. USE THIS ONLY
	 *  WHEN YOU ARE UNABLE TO GET THE APPROACH FOR A GIVEN PROBLEM AFTER APPLYING ALL WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT AND PRACTICED + Remember how your brain is converting the test data input to its expected output!
   
     If the head.next equal to null or k equal to one return head
     
 
	 * 6.Dry run the pseudo code with all test data from step #2
	 * 
	 * 7.Write the code on notepad
	 * 
	 * 8. Dry run the code with all test data from step #2
	 * 
	 * 9. Write code on IDE (remember to add comments and practice coding standards)
	 * 
	 * 10. Test the code + Debug the code (if any failures) Debug like a pro using debugging options of IDE
	 * 
	 * 11. Check for any gaps of code optimization (if not optimized already in Step #9)
