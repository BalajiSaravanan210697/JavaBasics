/*
	 * 1.Understanding the problem to detailed level (clarity on input and output,constraints)
	 * Yes
	 * input int[] ,int
	 * output int[]
	 * 2.Frame Test data (valid, invalid, complex and edge cases)
	 * Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 Output: [0,1]
	 * 3.Do you know the Solution?
	 * Yes
	 * 4.Do you have any alternate approaches? (Thing of alternate approaches)
	 * Yes
	 * 5. Derive Pseudo code in paper (for the best chosen approach) Use ChatGPT to get approach or hints not the entire solution or complete code. USE THIS ONLY
	 *  WHEN YOU ARE UNABLE TO GET THE APPROACH FOR A GIVEN PROBLEM AFTER APPLYING ALL WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT AND PRACTICED + Remember how your brain is converting the test data input to its expected output!
	
	 > Initialize the map to store the index and values
	 > Initialize int[] to store the output with size of 2
	 > for loop to iterate the map and set key as index and value index value
	 > if sum of values values equal to target 
	 > set the key value into output array
	 > return output array 	 
	   
	 * 6.Dry run the pseudo code with all test data from step #2
	 * 
	 * 7.Write the code on notepad
	 * 
	 * 8. Dry run the code with all test data from step #2
	 * 
	 * 9. Write code on IDE (remember to add comments and practice coding standards)
	 * 
	 * 10. Test the code + Debug the code (if any failures) Debug like a pro using debugging options of IDE
	 * 
	 * 11. Check for any gaps of code optimization (if not optimized already in Step #9)
