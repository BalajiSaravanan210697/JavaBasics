	/*
		 * 1.Understanding the problem to detailed level (clarity on input and output,constraints)
		 * Yes
		 * Input  - String,String output  - String
		 * 2.Frame Test data (valid, invalid, complex and edge cases)
		 * Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr" Output: "apbqcr"
		 * Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs" Output: "apbqrs"
		 * Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq" Output: "apbqcd"
		 * 3.Do you know the Solution?
		 * Yes
		 * 4.Do you have any alternate approaches? (Thing of alternate approaches)
		 * Yes
		 * 5. Derive Pseudo code in paper (for the best chosen approach) Use ChatGPT to get approach or hints not the entire solution or complete code. USE THIS ONLY
		 *  WHEN YOU ARE UNABLE TO GET THE APPROACH FOR A GIVEN PROBLEM AFTER APPLYING ALL WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT AND PRACTICED + Remember how your brain is converting the test data input to its expected output!
		 
		 
		 
		 
		 
		 
		 
		 * 6.Dry run the pseudo code with all test data from step #2
		 * 
		 * 7.Write the code on notepad
		 * 
		 * 8. Dry run the code with all test data from step #2
		 * 
		 * 9. Write code on IDE (remember to add comments and practice coding standards)
		 * 
		 * 10. Test the code + Debug the code (if any failures) Debug like a pro using debugging options of IDE
		 * 
		 * 11. Check for any gaps of code optimization (if not optimized already in Step #9)
